# Tracking App API built with Ruby on Rails
![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

## About the Project

As the final project at Microverse, this REST API was constructed using Ruby on Rails and Postgres for database management. It facilitates adding, editing, and removing records (measurements) and items (things to measure) via direct interaction with the database within the front-end application.

To understand its functionality, you can explore the Tracking App with React, the corresponding front-end application integrated with this API.

### Key Components:

- The database comprises three tables and corresponding models: User, Item, and Record.
- User table includes columns for username, password, and admin privileges.
- The items table features title, unit, icon, and target specifications columns.
- Records table consists of date, result, item_id, and user_id fields.
- User authorization is implemented using [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and [Rack-cors](https://github.com/cyu/rack-cors) for enhanced security.

Please check how this API works in the [Tracking App with React](https://github.com/yocosaka/Tracking-App-with-React), which is the front-end application built with React, corresponds to this API.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple example steps.

1. On the project GitHub page, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under the repository name, locate and click on a green button named `Code`. 
3. Copy the project URL as displayed.
4. If you're running the Windows Operating System, open your command prompt. On Linux, Open your terminal. 
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. Leave as it is if the current location is where you want the project to be. 
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3. <br>
e.g. $ git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/yourProjectName 
7. Press Enter. Your local copy will be created. 
8. To install all dependencies and necessary gems, run `bundle install`
9. Run `rails db:setup`
10. Run `rails server` to run rails application in your local server
11. Run `rspec` to run rspec tests

## How to allow the frontend app to interact with this API
1. Go to puma.rb in config/initializers, and rewrite the port from 3000 to 3001 like below:
e.g. `port ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3001 }`

2. Go to cors.rb in config/initializers, and rewrite the origins path for your frontend path in both local and production


## Authentication

- To manage records and items, it needs to log in with a username and a password. Then, you need to include a token, which is issued and passed by logged in, in the header when interacting with this API like below: 
`headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
},`
- Plus, to manage items, it needs to log in with the user account with the admin: true


## How to create admin user

This API administrator can create an admin user through the rails console in the local environment or using the rails database seed file whichever you like. For example, in the console, run IRB by `rails c`, then in the IRB console, you can create an admin user like below:
`User.create(username: 'admin', password: 'admin', admin: true)`

By default, I created the seeds file in this repository to create an admin user. So after `rails db:setup` at step 9 in the "Getting Started" section, the admin user will be automatically created.
